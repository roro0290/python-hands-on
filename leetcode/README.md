# LeetCode
As a developer transitioning from Java to Python, I've created this project to help familiarize myself with the fundamentals of Python syntax. Below is a list of key topics I will be exploring:
---
**Array**
| # | Title | Difficulty | Learning Points | Time Complexity |
|---| ----- | ---------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|1920| [Build Array From Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation) | Easy | - initialise a list <br> - access element <br> - append to the end | O(N) |
|1929| [Concatenation of Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/) | Easy | - operations to append an array to the back of another array | O(N) |
|1512| [Number of Good Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-pairs/) | Easy | - while loop <br> - double loop | O(N^2) |
